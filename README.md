# ShareMarket Prediction Web Appliaction

#### Part of the Summer 2021 Infosys InStep Program ####

## Description

*This project was done as a part of the InStep Internship program offered by Infosys in the Summer of 2021. Due to all project assets are  the property of Infosys, there is not much in terms of program files on this repository. This repository exists mainly as a place for all of the non company property files that were kept after the internship's 8-week duration had been completed.*

>This project will try to show first level of information glimpse for any stock’s future prediction using Open source technologies User can create his her profile, company information s/he is interested in and configure rules to check when it is right time to buy any stock.

As a result of the small team and short length of the internship, not all of the expected outcomes of the project were met. An internal Infosys team took over the work of the two interns working on the Share Market Prediction web application after the 8-week internship finished

    
## Software

- All missing PHP, CSS, and JavaScript files could be opened with a text editor, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
- A [PosGreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) was used for storing data
